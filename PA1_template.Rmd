# Reproducible Research:Peer Assessment 1
```{r,echo=TRUE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```

##Loading and preprocessing the data

1.Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

```{r,results='markup', warning=TRUE, mesaage=TRUE}
data<-read.csv('activity.csv')
```

2.Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```{r}
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
data$interval <- as.factor(data$interval)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
stepsperday <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(data$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(stepsperday) <- c("date","steps")
```

We display the first few rows of the averagealldays data frame:
```{r}
head(stepsperday)
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
hist(stepsperday$steps, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
     col="orange", 
     xlab="Total number of steps", 
     ylim=c(0, 20), 
     main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n(NA removed)")
```
   
2. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(stepsperday$steps)
median(stepsperday$steps)
```

The mean is 9354.23 and the median is 10395.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)\

```{r}
stepsperinterval <- aggregate(data$steps, 
                                by = list(interval = data$interval),
                                FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

stepsperinterval$interval <- as.integer(levels(stepsperinterval$interval)[stepsperinterval$interval])
colnames(stepsperinterval) <- c("interval", "steps")

```

We display the first few rows of the averagealldays data frame:
```{r}
head(stepsperinterval)
```

The time serie plot is created by the following lines of code
```{r}
ggplot(stepsperinterval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +   
        geom_line(color="orange", size=1) +  
        labs(title="Average Daily Activity Pattern", x="Interval", y="Number of steps") +  
        theme_bw()
```

```{r}
mean(stepsperinterval$interval)
median(stepsperinterval$interval)
```
These formulas gives a mean and median of 1177.5 and 1177.5 respectively.

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
stepsperinterval <- aggregate(data$steps, 
                                by = list(interval = data$interval),
                                FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
#convert to integers
##this helps in plotting
stepsperinterval$interval <- 
        as.integer(levels(stepsperinterval$interval)[stepsperinterval$interval])
colnames(stepsperinterval) <- c("interval", "steps")
```

We make the plot with the time series of the average number of steps taken (averaged across all days) versus the 5-minute intervals:

```{r}
ggplot(stepsperinterval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +   
        geom_line(color="orange", size=1) +  
        labs(title="Average Daily Activity Pattern", x="Interval", y="Number of steps") +  
        theme_bw()
```

Now, we find the 5-minute interval with the containing the maximum number of steps:

```{r}
max_interval <- stepsperinterval[which.max(  
        stepsperinterval$steps),]

max_interval
```

The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum of steps, on average across all days, is 835.

## Imputing missing values:

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```{r}
missing_vals <- sum(is.na(data$steps))
missing_vals
```

The total number of missing values are 2304.

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.

```{r}
na_fill <- function(data, pervalue) {
        na_index <- which(is.na(data$steps))
        na_replace <- unlist(lapply(na_index, FUN=function(idx){
                interval = data[idx,]$interval
                pervalue[pervalue$interval == interval,]$steps
        }))
        fill_steps <- data$steps
        fill_steps[na_index] <- na_replace
        fill_steps
}

```

Zero output shows that there are NO MISSING VALUES.

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
data_fill <- data.frame(  
        steps = na_fill(data, stepsperinterval),  
        date = data$date,  
        interval = data$interval)
str(data_fill)
```

To check whether any missing values remaining or not:
```{r}
sum(is.na(data_fill$steps))
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day 

```{r}
fill_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data_fill, sum)
colnames(fill_steps_per_day) <- c("date","steps")

##plotting the histogram
ggplot(fill_steps_per_day, aes(x = steps)) + 
       geom_histogram(fill = "orange", binwidth = 1000) + 
        labs(title="Histogram of Steps Taken per Day", 
             x = "Number of Steps per Day", y = "Number of times in a day(Count)") + theme_bw() 
```

```{r}
steps_mean_fill   <- mean(fill_steps_per_day$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
steps_mean_fill
steps_median_fill <- median(fill_steps_per_day$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
steps_median_fill
```

The mean is 10766.19 and median is 10766.19.

These values differ greatly from the estimates from the first part of the assignment. The impact of imputing the missing values is to have more data, hence to obtain a bigger mean and median value.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
weekdays_steps <- function(data) {
    weekdays_steps <- aggregate(data$steps, by=list(interval = data$interval),
                          FUN=mean, na.rm=T)
    # convert to integers for plotting
    weekdays_steps$interval <- 
            as.integer(levels(weekdays_steps$interval)[weekdays_steps$interval])
    colnames(weekdays_steps) <- c("interval", "steps")
    weekdays_steps
}

data_by_weekdays <- function(data) {
    data$weekday <- 
            as.factor(weekdays(data$date)) # weekdays
    weekend_data <- subset(data, weekday %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"))
    weekday_data <- subset(data, !weekday %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"))

    weekend_steps <- weekdays_steps(weekend_data)
    weekday_steps <- weekdays_steps(weekday_data)

    weekend_steps$dayofweek <- rep("weekend", nrow(weekend_steps))
    weekday_steps$dayofweek <- rep("weekday", nrow(weekday_steps))

    data_by_weekdays <- rbind(weekend_steps, weekday_steps)
    data_by_weekdays$dayofweek <- as.factor(data_by_weekdays$dayofweek)
    data_by_weekdays
}

data_weekdays <- data_by_weekdays(data_fill)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot 

```{r}
ggplot(data_weekdays, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) + 
        geom_line(color="orange") + 
        facet_wrap(~ dayofweek, nrow=2, ncol=1) +
        labs(x="Interval", y="Number of steps") +
        theme_bw()
```
